# Matrix

Welcome to Matrix on Exercism's Python Track.
If you need help running the tests or submitting your code, check out `HELP.md`.

## Instructions

Given a string representing a matrix of numbers, return the rows and columns of that matrix.

So given a string with embedded newlines like:

```text
9 8 7
5 3 2
6 6 7
```

representing this matrix:

```text
    1  2  3
  |---------
1 | 9  8  7
2 | 5  3  2
3 | 6  6  7
```

your code should be able to spit out:

- A list of the rows, reading each row left-to-right while moving top-to-bottom across the rows,
- A list of the columns, reading each column top-to-bottom while moving from left-to-right.

The rows for our example matrix:

- 9, 8, 7
- 5, 3, 2
- 6, 6, 7

And its columns:

- 9, 5, 6
- 8, 3, 6
- 7, 2, 7

## How this exercise is structured on the Python track

The tests for this exercise expect you to create a Matrix [`class`][classes] (_see also [concept:python/classes]()_).
This is different from _using_ a Matrix object from a third-party library such as [Numpy][numpy-matrix], which is not supported.
 _Don't worry, it's not as complicated as you think!_
 For more starting points and details on `classes` and data structures, take a look at the resources below:
